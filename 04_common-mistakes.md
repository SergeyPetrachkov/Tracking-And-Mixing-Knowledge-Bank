### ❌ Overusing Pro-Q Instead of Pro-MB
**Mistake**
- Static EQ cuts everywhere

**Fix**
- Use Pro-Q dynamic bands
- Use Pro-MB for movement-based control

### ❌ Crushing Everything with Distressor
**Mistake**
- Using Distressor like a limiter

**Fix**
- Distressor = character + control
- GR usually <10 dB (even on screams)

### ❌ Limiting Too Early with Pro-L
**Mistake**
- Mixing into Pro-L

**Fix**
- Pro-L only in mastering
- Loudness comes LAST
