# Tracking Levels – Metal Production

## Core Philosophy
- Record **clean, dynamic, unclipped** signals
- Leave **headroom** for mixing and mastering
- Do NOT chase loudness while tracking
- Plugins work best around **-18 dBFS RMS**

Target rule of thumb:
- **Peaks:** -10 to -6 dBFS
- **Average (RMS):** ~ -18 dBFS
- Never hit 0 dBFS

## 🎸 Guitars (Rhythm & Lead)

### DI Tracking
- Peaks: **-10 to -6 dBFS**
- RMS: **-18 to -14 dBFS**
- No compression
- No EQ
- Cleanest signal possible

### Amp / Fractal Printed Tracks
- Peaks: **-8 to -6 dBFS**
- RMS: **-18 to -14 dBFS**
- Avoid limiter or maximizer
- Saturation ONLY if part of tone

### Notes
- Quad tracking = consistency > loudness
- Avoid clipping transients; metal guitars still need attack
- Slightly quieter is always safer

## 🎸 Bass

### DI
- Peaks: **-10 to -6 dBFS**
- RMS: **-18 dBFS**
- No compression
- No EQ

### Fractal Bass Chain Print
- Peaks: **-8 to -6 dBFS**
- RMS: **-16 to -14 dBFS**
- Multiband compression OK if it’s part of tone
- No limiter

## 🎤 Vocals (Screams / Growls)

### Tracking Chain
- No compression OR very light compression
- No EQ except high-pass if needed

### Levels
- Peaks: **-8 to -6 dBFS**
- RMS: **-20 to -16 dBFS**

### Notes
- Screams are transient-heavy — peaks matter more than average
- Never clip
- It’s fine if screams look quieter than guitars visually

## 🥁 Drums (Addictive Drums 2)

### Individual Outputs
- Peaks: **-10 to -6 dBFS**
- RMS: **-18 dBFS**

### Drum Bus
- Peaks: **-6 dBFS max**
- RMS: **-16 dBFS**

### Notes
- Disable AD2 master limiter while tracking
- Let DAW handle gain staging

## 🎹 Synths / FX

- Peaks: **-10 dBFS**
- RMS: **-20 to -16 dBFS**
- Pads especially should stay quiet
